                                    The Atari jaguar is now a sought-after collectable, Lol I wish I never.
                                    sold my encased and sealed brand new one, whoops lol. I do have a loose one.
                                    that still fetches are $400 price tag and that is old and used. The system was.
                                    under scrutiny and attack when first released in 11-23-1993. The system claimed.
                                    be the most powerful system at the time with commercials in your face about how.
                                    the operating chips were pushing out 64bits of graphic power against the computer.
                                    which were producing 32bit systems. The catch was it was a dual chip core processor.
                                    code named Tom and Jerry which were both 32Bit processors. They added thirty-two plus 32 but the
                                    system was lacking luster at best with low frame rates and terrible games due to how hard.
                                    It was to code games on both chips. It failed abysmally with its prehistoric phone button.
                                    gaming controller which was bulky and terrible to use along with the overlays.
